# Ansible Tower Roadshow for VMWare 

No roles are used in the playbook because it is better to show a flat playbook at roadshows

Some Ansible Playbook examples for simple VMWare vCenter workloads
- create_from_template: create a new VM on vCenter based on supplied vars
- deploy_webserver: deploy a static page webserver on rhtest group
- subsribe_rhel_std: updating hostname and subscribing system to RHEL Std for rhtest group
